Hedgewars is turn-based Worms-like strategy game.

Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the game,
players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and
weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways,
normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the
"Rope" or "Parachute", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is
time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
thinking or moving. A large variety of tools and weapons are available for
players during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Shotgun, Desert
Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic pick,
Parachute.
