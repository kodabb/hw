/**
 * This file defines a data structure for a hedgewars team.
 *
 * Teams are used in several different contexts in Hedgewars, and some of these require
 * extra information about teams. For example, the weaponset is important
 * to the engine, but not for ini reading/writing, and with the team statistics it is the
 * other way around. To keep things simple, the data structure can hold all information
 * used in any context. On the downside, that means we can't use static typing to ensure
 * that team information is "complete" for a particular purpose.
