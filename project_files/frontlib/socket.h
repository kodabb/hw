 * Sockets for TCP networking.

 * This layer offers some functionality over what SDL_net offers directly: listening
 * sockets (called acceptors here) can be bound to port 0, which will make them listen
 * on a random unused port, if one can be found. To support this feature, you can also
 * query the local port that an acceptor is listening on.
 *
 * Further, we support nonblocking reads here.
