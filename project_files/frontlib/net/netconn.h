/**
 * This file contains functions for communicating with a Hedgewars server to chat, prepare and play
 * rounds of Hedgewars.
 *
 * To use this, first create a netconn object by calling flib_netconn_create. This will start the
 * connection to the game server (which might fail right away, the function returns null then). You
 * should also register your callback functions right at the start to ensure you don't miss any
 * callbacks.
 *
 * In order to allow the netconn to run, you should regularly call flib_netconn_tick(), which
 * performs network I/O and calls your callbacks on interesting events.
 *
 * When the connection is closed, you will receive the onDisconnect callback. This is the signal to
 * destroy the netconn and stop calling tick().
 *
 * The connection process lasts from the time you create the netconn until you receive the
 * onConnected callback (or onDisconnected in case something goes wrong). During that time, you
 * might receive the onNickTaken and onPasswordRequest callbacks; see their description for more
 * information on how to handle them. You could also receive other callbacks during connecting (e.g.
 * about the room list), but it should be safe to ignore them.
 *
 * Once you are connected, you are in the lobby, and you can enter rooms and leave them again. The
 * room and lobby states have different protocols, so many commands only work in either one or the
 * other. If you are in a room you might also be in a game, but most of the functions behave the
 * same ingame as in a room.
 *
 * The state changes from lobby to room when the server tells you that you just entered one, which
 * will also trigger the onEnterRoom callback. This usually happens in reply to either a joinRoom,
 * createRoom or playerFollow command.
 *
 * The state changes back to lobby when the room is dissolved, when you are kicked from the room, or
 * when you actively leave the room using flib_netconn_send_leaveRoom. The first two events will
 * trigger the onLeaveRoom callback.
