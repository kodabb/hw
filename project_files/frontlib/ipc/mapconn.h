/**
 * Functions for querying a map preview from the engine, which includes both a two-color image
 * and the number of hogs this map is suitable for.
 *
 * The general usage is to first create a mapconn object by calling flib_mapconn_create.
 * That will cause the frontlib to listen on a random port which can be queried using
 * flib_mapconn_getport(). You should also register your callback functions right at the start
 * to ensure you don't miss any callbacks.
 *
 * Next, start the engine (that part is up to you) with the appropriate command line arguments
 * for a map preview request.
 *
 * In order to allow the mapconn to run, you should regularly call flib_mapconn_tick(), which
 * performs network I/O and calls your callbacks if the map has been generated or an error
 * has occurred. Once either the onSuccess or onFailure callback is called, you should destroy
 * the mapconn and stop calling tick().
