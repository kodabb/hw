/**
 * This file contains functions for starting and interacting with a game run by the engine.
 * The general usage is to first create a gameconn object by calling one of the flib_gameconn_create
 * functions. That will cause the frontlib to listen on a random port which can be queried using
 * flib_gameconn_getport(). You should also register your callback functions right at the start
 * to ensure you don't miss any callbacks.
 *
 * Next, start the engine (that part is up to you) with the appropriate command line arguments
 * for starting a game.
 *
 * In order to allow the gameconn to run, you should regularly call flib_gameconn_tick(), which
 * performs network I/O and calls your callbacks on interesting events.
 *
 * Once the engine connects, the gameconn will send it the required commands for starting the
 * game you requested in your flib_gameconn_create call.
 *
 * When the game is finished (or the connection is lost), you will receive the onDisconnect
 * message. This is the signal to destroy the gameconn and stop calling tick().
